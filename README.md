# cache-modeling-tool
Simple Javascript tool to solve cache modeling problems from CS224.

## Where is it?
The tool can be accessed publicly at: https://deterjan.github.io/cache-modeling-tool/

## Does it work?
I hope it does. You can find a list of test cases obtained from the previously asked questions archive in 
[this file](https://github.com/deterjan/cache-modeling-tool/blob/gh-pages/tests.js)
and run all of these cases to make sure the code is OK
